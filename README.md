# MesemondoBookReviewApp
Mesemondo, the Hungarian word for "storyteller", is a book review app that allows users to add books to their profile that they have read and leave a brief review of it.
Users can also upload books they have not read but would like to and can set a reading goal of the number of books they would like to have read within the year. Once they reach their goal they will get a notification "CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'VE REACHED YOUR GOAL!"
